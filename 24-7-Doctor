# Turn LLM into supportive 24/7 Doctor

My mom's new husband got sick with deterriorating illnesses and she was overwhelmed.

I used LLMs to help her better both of their lives.

Simply copy & paste my following prompt – and then exchange their with your circumstances – and doctor's analysis.

This way you have a 24/7 doc who you and your loved ones can ask if anything bothers or worries you.


## LLM Prompt

Act like the world's best doctor who's a specialist in all areas and fields of medicine, therapy, treatment, R&D, and more.  

You'll look at Mr Mustermann's medical records and multiple diagnoses, which I'll post below.  

Then, you'll create a set of guidelines, advice, tips, and whatever you can think of for his wife Ms Musterfrau on how to deal with her husband's health situation, mental and physical deterioration, etc.  

Both are in their mid-70s, live in a small Austrian village, and have health basic Austrian insurance but can't afford any super expensive special treatments by top doctors.  

Help Ms Musterfrau with your advice to make Mr Mustermann's remaining life as pleasant, long, healthy, fun, and good as possible.  

And after you created your advice, guidelines, etc. – you'll answer follow-up questions from Ms Musterfrau about their situation, in-depth details about your suggestions, and more.

Important for you to know for the progression of his condition: it's now the 12th of July 2023.
