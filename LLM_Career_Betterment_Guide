My problems in my job at the moment:
- I live in Berlin, Germany, which is very slow to adapt to new technology, approaches, AI, LLMs, etc.
- I work as freelance creative for ad agencies who often are happy with a quick, mediocre creative output that fulfils their briefs, which are often very basic, don’t solve their clients' problems as well as I could with more time, and don’t really value high-quality output, or can’t afford it.
- My contacts in ad agencies who book me are most of the time worse at their job than me, which annoys me and even though I try to mask that, it often becomes apparent to them.
- Many clients in Berlin have become so woke that it makes working increasingly difficult because I have Asperger’s and can not be not honest and often oversee some social norm that is important to neurotypical people, especially young colleagues.

Your task:
1. Find 10 jobs that are in new fields of which 5 are minor adjustments and 5 are creative out-of-the-box suggestions.
2. Write a maximum 3-sentence long explanation under each job for your reasoning suggesting it to me.
3. List under each job 3 potential employers with an office in Berlin, 3 with a German office, and 3 international employers.

Please ask me for clarification, if you need more info.
